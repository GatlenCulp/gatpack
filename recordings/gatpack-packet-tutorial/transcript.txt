Here's a setup, tutorial and demo of how to use gatpack. So,

00:00:02:51 - 00:00:03:46
Unknown
if you can run this

00:00:03:46 - 00:00:08:09
Unknown
command here in your terminal by opening up the terminal this way and just click on terminal,

00:00:08:13 - 00:00:13:55
Unknown
using Spotlight search. Great. Otherwise, I'm going to walk through and complete the Getting Started guide.

00:00:14:02 - 00:00:14:26
Unknown
So,

00:00:14:26 - 00:00:16:19
Unknown
I'm not going to walk through how to install,

00:00:16:19 - 00:00:17:38
Unknown
latka on your machine.

00:00:17:38 - 00:00:23:43
Unknown
You can look up how to do that. If you do have Mac there, you could do brew install task attack

00:00:23:43 - 00:00:26:40
Unknown
brew is a package management system for Mac, specifically

00:00:26:40 - 00:00:29:19
Unknown
and it comes in a lot of handy. So

00:00:29:19 - 00:00:31:34
Unknown
Gap Hack is just a normal Python package.

00:00:31:34 - 00:00:35:27
Unknown
And you can install it using whatever system you want to.

00:00:35:31 - 00:00:37:22
Unknown
Pip install gatpack,

00:00:37:22 - 00:00:38:54
Unknown
would typically work, but,

00:00:38:54 - 00:00:39:24
Unknown
Python

00:00:39:24 - 00:00:41:51
Unknown
discourages globally install packages.

00:00:41:56 - 00:00:42:46
Unknown
For this

00:00:42:46 - 00:00:44:45
Unknown
purpose I recommend using UV.

00:00:44:45 - 00:00:48:00
Unknown
So to install UV if you have brew,

00:00:48:00 - 00:00:52:42
Unknown
do brew install UV. Otherwise you can go to their website and find out how to do so.

00:00:52:42 - 00:00:56:34
Unknown
But once it's installed you can do UV tool, install gatpack

00:00:56:34 - 00:01:00:02
Unknown
and it will pull it from PyPI. Then if you run gatpack,

00:01:00:06 - 00:01:00:27
Unknown
help.

00:01:00:27 - 00:01:02:03
Unknown
You should have it here. So

00:01:02:03 - 00:01:03:09
Unknown
to start your project,

00:01:03:09 - 00:01:06:19
Unknown
you're going to want to change directory into

00:01:06:19 - 00:01:10:51
Unknown
wherever you want to put your project. So for me I'm going to put it into documents. So if I go CD

00:01:10:51 - 00:01:14:27
Unknown
documents where the little squiggle just means your home folder.

00:01:14:27 - 00:01:14:53
Unknown
So

00:01:14:53 - 00:01:16:51
Unknown
I am going to go ahead and

00:01:16:51 - 00:01:18:14
Unknown
run the command gatpack.

00:01:18:20 - 00:01:18:34
Unknown
It.

00:01:18:34 - 00:01:22:27
Unknown
Can ask me if I want to redownload it. That's perfectly fine. Project name.

00:01:22:32 - 00:01:24:38
Unknown
Let's name this video tutorial

00:01:24:38 - 00:01:26:52
Unknown
two because I already had a failed run earlier

00:01:26:52 - 00:01:27:50
Unknown
and we'll go through there.

00:01:27:50 - 00:01:30:08
Unknown
And now we have Video tutorial two. So

00:01:30:08 - 00:01:31:42
Unknown
we're going to

00:01:31:42 - 00:01:32:11
Unknown
create

00:01:32:15 - 00:01:33:33
Unknown
so we have a few

00:01:33:33 - 00:01:35:19
Unknown
files here and a directory

00:01:35:19 - 00:01:36:26
Unknown
reading packet example.

00:01:36:26 - 00:01:36:52
Unknown
So

00:01:36:52 - 00:01:38:14
Unknown
that is the one that you're going

00:01:38:14 - 00:01:39:31
Unknown
to enter into.

00:01:39:35 - 00:01:42:12
Unknown
Okay. So this is really what.

00:01:42:12 - 00:01:43:07
Unknown
A get back project

00:01:43:07 - 00:01:43:37
Unknown
looks like.

00:01:43:42 - 00:01:48:50
Unknown
Primarily it's indicated by the composer gatpack dot Json file, which contains

00:01:48:50 - 00:01:51:46
Unknown
information about how to build your document.

00:01:51:46 - 00:01:54:39
Unknown
So just to make sure this works before anything else, I'm going to run

00:01:54:39 - 00:01:56:29
Unknown
gatpack compose

00:01:56:29 - 00:02:00:29
Unknown
and run that, and it will tell me which pipelines are available.

00:02:00:29 - 00:02:02:00
Unknown
Currently I just have reading packet,

00:02:02:00 - 00:02:04:34
Unknown
so I'll run gatpack Compose

00:02:04:34 - 00:02:05:42
Unknown
reading packet

00:02:05:42 - 00:02:11:06
Unknown
and then I'll just put the overwrite there. So in case there is any PDF files that I forgot to take out of the template, it will overwrite them.

00:02:11:06 - 00:02:12:04
Unknown
So go through that

00:02:12:04 - 00:02:15:09
Unknown
and we should be good. So now I'll

00:02:15:09 - 00:02:16:01
Unknown
check my output.

00:02:16:01 - 00:02:16:21
Unknown
Here I'll

00:02:16:21 - 00:02:18:06
Unknown
open this up in finder real

00:02:18:19 - 00:02:25:29
Unknown
we'll go to output, and then we've got two packets here. So we got a pack of the footers and just a regular packet. So I'm just gonna open up pack with footers

00:02:25:32 - 00:02:26:11
Unknown
we got our packet

00:02:26:11 - 00:02:26:38
Unknown
here.

00:02:26:38 - 00:02:27:13
Unknown
I got some

00:02:27:13 - 00:02:28:18
Unknown
online readings.

00:02:28:23 - 00:02:29:40
Unknown
We've got a few

00:02:29:40 - 00:02:31:47
Unknown
PDF files that were added to this.

00:02:31:47 - 00:02:33:36
Unknown
And if we scroll to the bottom

00:02:33:36 - 00:02:35:22
Unknown
we've got some further readings

00:02:35:44 - 00:02:38:16
Unknown
You can use VS code or whatever text editor you want to

00:02:38:16 - 00:02:39:13
Unknown
If we open up

00:02:39:13 - 00:02:41:11
Unknown
compose not get package.json,

00:02:41:11 - 00:02:41:49
Unknown
we can see

00:02:41:49 - 00:02:42:18
Unknown
the setup.

00:02:42:18 - 00:02:46:15
Unknown
The name of this got pack compose files intro fellowship reading packet.

00:02:46:17 - 00:02:47:45
Unknown
The description I just put as a,

00:02:47:45 - 00:02:51:17
Unknown
packet for spring 2025. Intro fellowship.

00:02:51:24 - 00:02:53:16
Unknown
So what is stored in context?

00:02:53:16 - 00:02:54:16
Unknown
the context

00:02:54:16 - 00:02:58:15
Unknown
provides the values to fill in the placeholders within the document.

00:02:58:15 - 00:02:59:44
Unknown
Over here we've got time period

00:02:59:44 - 00:03:01:31
Unknown
and we've got time period over here.

00:03:01:31 - 00:03:03:36
Unknown
And we might also have,

00:03:03:36 - 00:03:04:02
Unknown
a loop.

00:03:04:02 - 00:03:06:48
Unknown
So over here we have for reading and core readings, we

00:03:06:48 - 00:03:07:54
Unknown
list them all out.

00:03:07:54 - 00:03:13:30
Unknown
And so this is the core readings list. And within each of these is some definition

00:03:13:30 - 00:03:14:30
Unknown
of the readings.

00:03:14:30 - 00:03:15:38
Unknown
what controls

00:03:15:38 - 00:03:16:25
Unknown
merging together

00:03:16:25 - 00:03:16:45
Unknown
these

00:03:16:45 - 00:03:18:24
Unknown
documents, which are rendered to PDFs?

00:03:18:24 - 00:03:20:22
Unknown
Well, that would be the pipelines

00:03:20:38 - 00:03:22:24
Unknown
back when you ran get back compose.

00:03:22:24 - 00:03:25:24
Unknown
We saw that we had one pipeline and that was reading packet

00:03:25:27 - 00:03:26:34
Unknown
And here it is

00:03:26:38 - 00:03:27:43
Unknown
all the steps

00:03:27:43 - 00:03:29:06
Unknown
are like so.

00:03:29:10 - 00:03:33:26
Unknown
You render the cover page using the context from above and then you just. Yeah.

00:03:33:26 - 00:03:35:35
Unknown
From this to the PDF here.

00:03:35:35 - 00:03:38:29
Unknown
Same thing for the device readings page from here to here.

00:03:38:29 - 00:03:41:35
Unknown
And then from further readings page from here to here.

00:03:41:35 - 00:03:44:54
Unknown
Lastly we just combine all the PDFs and save it to output

00:03:44:54 - 00:03:49:11
Unknown
package PDF. And more recently I added the ability to add a footer.

00:03:49:13 - 00:03:50:48
Unknown
if we go to the

00:03:50:48 - 00:03:51:46
Unknown
Package with footers,

00:03:51:46 - 00:03:57:18
Unknown
scroll down a little bit. You can see what I mean. So you have 749 in the corner here, 8 to 49.

00:03:57:18 - 00:04:00:53
Unknown
And so on throughout the entire PDF. That's what the footer does.

00:04:01:02 - 00:04:02:25
Unknown
So I'll just go up to the top

00:04:02:25 - 00:04:02:42
Unknown
and I'll

00:04:02:50 - 00:04:03:38
Unknown
change this

00:04:03:38 - 00:04:05:37
Unknown
spring 2025 to,

00:04:05:42 - 00:04:09:00
Unknown
3084.

00:04:09:00 - 00:04:09:47
Unknown
And I'll

00:04:09:47 - 00:04:10:38
Unknown
render that

00:04:10:38 - 00:04:11:02
Unknown
to.

00:04:11:02 - 00:04:14:45
Unknown
And I'll run that with the overwrite flag. So that way I will delete anything else.

00:04:14:45 - 00:04:17:26
Unknown
And you can see that is updated at 380

00:04:17:26 - 00:04:18:09
Unknown
over here. We can

00:04:18:09 - 00:04:18:39
Unknown
add

00:04:18:39 - 00:04:19:53
Unknown
more readings.

00:04:19:53 - 00:04:24:18
Unknown
Just by copying pasting this and filling out the information there.

00:04:24:18 - 00:04:24:40
Unknown
I'm.

00:04:24:44 - 00:04:26:01
Unknown
And if we run it again.

00:04:26:01 - 00:04:28:12
Unknown
We can see I just duplicated those

00:04:28:12 - 00:04:31:41
Unknown
And to browse the intermediate documents. You can just come over to

00:04:31:41 - 00:04:35:41
Unknown
oh one cover. O2 device readings, oh three core readings and oh for further readings

00:04:36:01 - 00:04:42:17
Unknown
if it has jinja in the name, that means that it was the template file without any of the placeholders replaced.

00:04:42:28 - 00:04:44:52
Unknown
And then if we go to covered up PDF without the jinja,

00:04:44:52 - 00:04:47:36
Unknown
we'll see what it rendered out to. And this is just one page.

00:04:47:36 - 00:04:55:10
Unknown
If we go to device readings this was the templates. And then device readings that the jinja will contain what was actually rendered.

00:04:55:15 - 00:04:56:34
Unknown
Same thing for the further readings.

00:04:56:38 - 00:05:00:12
Unknown
The interesting one would probably be the core readings, though.

00:05:00:17 - 00:05:02:27
Unknown
That's kind of the the meat of the packet.

00:05:02:27 - 00:05:03:41
Unknown
So within core readings,

00:05:03:41 - 00:05:04:34
Unknown
you'll see

00:05:04:34 - 00:05:08:29
Unknown
I have them labeled with 01020304.

00:05:08:29 - 00:05:11:24
Unknown
The reason for that is within the pipeline

00:05:11:24 - 00:05:16:38
Unknown
where I have combine all readings in to pack it up. PDF. This third entry here

00:05:16:38 - 00:05:24:42
Unknown
where I have the core Reading starter PDF, it will select all of the PDFs within this file alphabetically

00:05:24:42 - 00:05:26:12
Unknown
and then combine them.

00:05:26:12 - 00:05:28:06
Unknown
if I wanted to remove

00:05:28:06 - 00:05:30:49
Unknown
what will GP 2030 look like.

00:05:30:49 - 00:05:31:33
Unknown
I could

00:05:31:33 - 00:05:32:06
Unknown
delete it.

00:05:32:06 - 00:05:35:53
Unknown
And if I were to render out the packet again it won't appear.

00:05:35:53 - 00:05:37:44
Unknown
if we wanted to introduce another reading,

00:05:37:44 - 00:05:38:47
Unknown
let's say

00:05:38:47 - 00:05:41:50
Unknown
covered our jinja that PDF just so I can pull a random PDF out.

00:05:41:50 - 00:05:45:40
Unknown
I'll put it over here. Go ahead and rename that to,

00:05:45:44 - 00:05:48:14
Unknown
let's put it right after the first reading.

00:05:48:14 - 00:05:50:02
Unknown
So we'll do oh to cover

00:05:50:02 - 00:05:51:17
Unknown
rename these real quick.

00:05:51:17 - 00:05:52:50
Unknown
So that way they're in the proper order.

00:05:52:50 - 00:05:53:49
Unknown
Now let's run this again.

00:05:53:49 - 00:05:56:33
Unknown
And let's check on the packet with footers.

00:05:56:33 - 00:05:58:18
Unknown
So we've got the first reading here.

00:05:58:18 - 00:05:59:33
Unknown
And then

00:05:59:33 - 00:06:01:01
Unknown
we've got the second reading.

00:06:01:01 - 00:06:02:04
Unknown
The third reading.

00:06:02:09 - 00:06:03:40
Unknown
And then the fourth reading.

00:06:03:44 - 00:06:04:40
Unknown
We'll have to fix that.

00:06:04:40 - 00:06:06:44
Unknown
Onto recommended usage. Forget pack.

00:06:06:44 - 00:06:20:16
Unknown
So I'm back in the folder that was originally created when we ran our pack in. Net video Tutorial two. Everything we're working with just previously is right over here, but I decided to zoom out a little bit more so we can talk about how to manage multiple packets together.

00:06:20:19 - 00:06:22:52
Unknown
my recommended way of doing this would be

00:06:22:52 - 00:06:25:53
Unknown
duplicate this and we'll just name it like week one.

00:06:26:00 - 00:06:30:02
Unknown
Maybe you can figure this with all of your team settings. You know, instead of just,

00:06:30:07 - 00:06:30:30
Unknown
having

00:06:30:30 - 00:06:37:08
Unknown
the defaults. You can put in yours. You are probably not changing your program's name from week to week.

00:06:37:08 - 00:06:38:32
Unknown
You should probably change that

00:06:38:39 - 00:06:40:55
Unknown
You could also use a general gatpack

00:06:40:55 - 00:06:42:15
Unknown
Compose file up here.

00:06:42:27 - 00:06:45:37
Unknown
And the route that also works perfectly fine.

00:06:45:37 - 00:06:47:22
Unknown
I have week one, week two.

00:06:47:22 - 00:06:51:39
Unknown
Week three. And you can run each of these individually by going to the terminal

00:06:51:39 - 00:06:52:22
Unknown
and

00:06:52:22 - 00:06:54:12
Unknown
going to that particular week

00:06:54:12 - 00:06:56:37
Unknown
and running gatpack Compose

00:06:56:37 - 00:06:57:06
Unknown
there.

00:06:57:11 - 00:07:04:12
Unknown
So this would create within week two. And if I go to the route and I run get back compose or throw an error because it couldn't find anything.

00:07:04:12 - 00:07:04:34
Unknown
So

00:07:04:34 - 00:07:05:49
Unknown
that's my recommended way.

00:07:05:53 - 00:07:07:27
Unknown
Create a bunch of packets within the top,

00:07:07:32 - 00:07:10:19
Unknown
and copy over settings that way, or create

00:07:10:19 - 00:07:10:24
Unknown
a

00:07:10:24 - 00:07:11:39
Unknown
global get back compose.

00:07:11:39 - 00:07:15:05
Unknown
Then with all of these together, you could create a GitHub.

00:07:15:05 - 00:07:18:17
Unknown
GitHub repo create and I can name it like

00:07:18:17 - 00:07:19:05
Unknown
packets

00:07:19:09 - 00:07:19:32
Unknown
and

00:07:19:32 - 00:07:20:03
Unknown
push it.

00:07:20:03 - 00:07:22:24
Unknown
But yeah, I have to run get a net first on this.

00:07:22:24 - 00:07:28:40
Unknown
Then you can share this with your team. Your team can make the edits. And so long as they have got back installed, they should be able to render out the PDFs as well.

00:07:28:52 - 00:07:35:55
Unknown
A second useful thing is that I've created this massive repository of readings for you and safety groups. These are all the readings that,

00:07:35:55 - 00:07:37:49
Unknown
based Harvard University Group,

00:07:37:49 - 00:07:38:19

been using for the past three years, either for their safety fundamentals or

00:07:45:23 - 00:07:46:12
Unknown
member meetings

00:07:46:18 - 00:07:50:46

This can be really helpful if you're trying to design your own AI safety fundamentals course or just like a reading

00:07:50:46 - 00:07:54:04
Unknown
for members meeting or share papers with others.

00:07:54:06 - 00:07:55:55
Unknown
one of the big benefits of this

00:07:55:55 - 00:07:57:38
Unknown
is I have already

00:07:57:38 - 00:07:59:39
Unknown
created the PDFs for you.

00:07:59:39 - 00:07:59:53
Unknown
some

00:07:59:53 - 00:08:02:30
Unknown
websites are extremely hard to format.

00:08:02:35 - 00:08:03:11
Unknown
You know,

00:08:03:11 - 00:08:13:18
Unknown
the text will either be, like, too big or too small. You'll have pictures hanging off the side of your PDF. And when you use this, you can just control app and search for the PDF that you want and then download it.

00:08:13:18 - 00:08:19:07
Unknown
there's the trimmed PDF here and there's the complete PDF. The differences between these are that the complete PDF is

00:08:19:07 - 00:08:19:16
Unknown
the

00:08:19:16 - 00:08:24:25
Unknown
unfiltered version of the document. Meanwhile, the trimmed PDF is down to the subsection that I have labeled

00:08:24:25 - 00:08:25:03
Unknown
here.

00:08:25:03 - 00:08:25:56
Unknown
that's why you'll see

00:08:25:56 - 00:08:28:01
Unknown
multiple entries for the same reading.

00:08:28:01 - 00:08:31:10
Unknown
here is adversarial. Examples are not bugs. They're features

00:08:31:10 - 00:08:37:39
Unknown
without any subsection. This one has a subsections one through three. And so while the complete PDF is going to be exactly the same for the two,

00:08:37:39 - 00:08:37:49
Unknown
this

00:08:37:49 - 00:08:38:24
Unknown
will contain

00:08:38:24 - 00:08:39:29
Unknown
the entire reading.

00:08:39:29 - 00:08:40:21
Unknown
But this one

00:08:40:21 - 00:08:42:27
Unknown
will only contain the first three sections.

00:08:42:32 - 00:08:44:05
Unknown
That way you're not wasting paper

00:08:44:05 - 00:08:49:08
Unknown
lastly, if you're having any difficulties with the software or maybe you want to do anything custom and special and

00:08:49:08 - 00:08:51:34
Unknown
here in the university group, feel free

00:08:51:34 - 00:08:52:25
Unknown
Reach out to me,

00:08:52:25 - 00:08:55:28
Unknown
by my contact page over at MIT edu

00:08:55:28 - 00:08:56:08
Unknown
till they

00:08:56:12 - 00:08:57:19
Unknown
permission or contact,

00:08:57:19 - 00:08:58:06
Unknown
send me a message.

00:08:58:10 - 00:08:58:27
Unknown
if you're

00:08:58:27 - 00:09:00:26
Unknown
interested in contributing to the

00:09:00:26 - 00:09:01:38
Unknown
LA tech templates

00:09:01:38 - 00:09:02:24
Unknown
that would be

00:09:02:24 - 00:09:03:15
Unknown
very helpful because

00:09:03:15 - 00:09:10:38
Unknown
they're very ugly compared with the ones I had originally, which were using a Microsoft word template instead of with tech, which

00:09:10:38 - 00:09:12:08
Unknown
was an awful idea.

00:09:12:08 - 00:09:14:01
Unknown
But anyways, thank you very much.

00:09:14:01 - 00:09:14:36
Unknown
Have a good day.
